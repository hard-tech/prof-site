                Annie	and	Mark	talk	about	gender	stereotypes
So	this	image	is	the	symbol	for	the	man	and	the	symbol	for	the	
woman	surrounded	by	labels	that	we	tend	to	give	people	as	gender	
stereotypes,	which	is	the	idea	that	we	label	certain	genders	based	on	
what	people	with	maybe	prejudice	or	just	stereotypical	ideas	about	
what	certain	genders	represent.	Like	the	man	is	strong	and	the	
woman	is	beautiful.	Do	you	agree	with	some	of	these	labels,	do	they
traditionally	line	up?<br><br><br>
Yeah,	definitely,	traditionally	they	line	up.	<mark>Man	is	a	money	maker,	the	
woman	is	sensitive,	the	man	is	adventurous,	the	woman	is	tidy,	etc.<br><br>
Those	role	models	we	have	as	kids,	unfortunately	they	can	limit	us	a	
bit.	When	I	was	growing	up	the	kids	focussed	on	G.I	Joe	if	you	were	a	
boy.	The	idea	of	a	tough	guy,	a	man’s	man…Tough	it	out,	boys	don’t	
cry.	Which	is	a	shame	when	you	think	about	it,	because	it	really	limits	
you	from	expressing	yourself.</mark><br><br><br>
And	on	the	other	side	we	have	the	Barbie	girl,	the	girly	girl.	When	you	
think	about	that	too,	right	now,	when you	think	about	the	gender	
stereotypes	that	we	have…<br><br><br>
When	I	was	a	child…	I	don’t	remember	having	role	models	in	film	
characters	or	TV	personalities.	I	do	remember	looking	up	to	people	in	
my	family.	For	example, <mark> I	looked	up	to	my	dad	a	lot,	I	liked	the	music	
that	he	listened	to.	And	I	think	that	children	need	to	have	role	models	
that	they	can	look	up	to	because	they	build	their	identity	and	they	
start	to	find	out	who	they	are	partly	through	role	models.</mark>
